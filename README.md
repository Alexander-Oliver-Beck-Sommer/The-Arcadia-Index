# The Hunter Wilhelm INDEX
Hello there! Welcome to my repository for a web application centered around information related to a novel series I'm currently writing. Please note: this project is a work in progress.

## What exactly is "Hunter Wilhelm?"
The name "Hunter Wilhelm" refers to a novel series I'm currently working on. It delves into dark fantasy, where the reality of the world is divided into three distinct realms of existence: Arcadia at the top, Fantasia in the middle, and Claymore at the bottom. The narrative revolves around monster slayers, commonly known as hunters. In this world, a hunter named "Wilhelm" is one day commissioned by a family to find a cure for a deeply cursed child named "Emily Dafton". However, as he progresses on his journey, whispers and rumors start emerging, hinting at an ancient prophecy known as "The Golden Wedding".

## Fine, fine... But why the "INDEX" in the name?
As mentioned, this repository is dedicated to an online application that provides detailed information about the universe of the novel series. This encompasses world maps of the three distinct realms of existence, as well as details about creatures, races, cities, factions, characters, events, and more. At the moment, the primary focus of the website is on the map interface, where users can drag and zoom to explore. They can navigate between the realms of Arcadia, Fantasia, and Claymore. On each map, there are various points of interest that users can delve into, gaining insights into statistics, appearances, and their roles within the narrative. Additionally, there will be an option to visit a secondary page that serves as an index or documentation, offering further insights into the rich lore of the "Hunter Wilhelm" universe.
